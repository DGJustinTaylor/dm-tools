# A. Overview

Some tools I'm creating to help me with being a dungeon master for 
Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. Some tools I plan on writing are 
as follows:

- Combat tracker
- Background character generator
- Generic loot generator

For character and loot generators, I plan on including the ability 
to gather basic environment data from a file to prevent outlandish 
generations.

I will create these tools using some combination (at least 1) of 
the following languages because of both learning purposes and their 
ease of use:

- Python
- Ruby
- Java
