# *README*

# A. Overview

Some tools I'm creating to help me with being a dungeon master for 
Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. 

# B. Tools

Some tools I plan on writing are as follows:

- Combat tracker
- Background character generator
- Generic loot generator

For character and loot generators, I plan on including the ability 
to gather basic environment data from a file to prevent outlandish 
generations.

# C. Usage

I'll fill this in later once I have something written.

# D. Implementation

I will create these tools using Ruby, since this way I can learn Ruby.
